                        </blockquote>
                        <p>After reviewing and criticising the previous investigations on politeness
                          theory, the selected paper (Long, 2016) argued for a social cognitive model
                          which integrates the underlying cognitive mechanism to account for politeness
                          research. The contributions of this model included that (1) it reiterated the
                          importance of second order theoretical conceptualisations, compared with its
                          first order counterparts centring around interlocuters’ interpretation of the
                          situations; (2) it discussed the difference between culture-general and
                          culture-specific second order constructs, and developed a new model based on the
                          former one; (3) it integrated previous culture-general elements (e.g. normative
                          predictability) and addressed possible invalid content of the earlier arguments
                          (e.g. to use culture-general model to account for culture-specific phenomena);
                          (4) the proposed model examined the negotiation of role-relation in relational
                          works in particular, but not the universal cognitive mechanism underlying all
                          human behaviours; (5) it incorporates two dimensions of the processing
                          mechanisms of relational works, that is, cognitive and affective salience; (6)
                          it simultaneously argued for correlative salience (within interlocutor
                          expectations or normatively predictable) and contrastive salience (outside of
                          interlocutor expectations or less normatively predictable), leading to its
                          capacity to account for both volitional (strategic) and discernment (deference)
                          forms.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;As a critical review, the scope of the present essay will be the evaluation and
                          improvement of the model proposed by Long (2016), from the perspective of the
                          validity of cognitive salience, the cognitive-affective tie, and the speculation
                          on the model of single factor cognitive mechanism. Firstly, the current review
                          will argue against the simple decision process between correlative and
                          contrastive salience, with evidence of the evolving concept of expectations and
                          multiple expectations (e.g. alignment) in the organisational setting. Secondly,
                          the cognitive-affective tie proposed in the model will be examined from the
                          perspective of the affectively unneutral nature of expectations, with reference
                          to reasonable hostility and other relevant phenomena. Thirdly, after discussing
                          the validity of the proposed model, the essay will examine the basic principles
                          implied by the model, they are, the single cognitive processing mechanism of
                          relational work (salience) and the mutual-interest cooperative assumption of
                          communication. </p>

			    <h4>Dynamic Nature of Expectations</h4>
                <p>Long (2016) formulated his model based on two lines of cognitive salience, operationalised to be ‘inside expectation’ and ‘outside expectation’. If a certain behaviour is identified to be correlative salience, this normatively predictable act indexes a role-relation with an affirmation to interlocutor expectation. In contrast, the behaviour against expectations which is less normatively predictable falls within the scope of contrastive salience. Being independent of and compatible with the culture-specific model(s), this social cognitive model is plausible because it can set the ground for more situational interpretations and allows the possibilities of situated norms (Tracy, 2008) at the culture-specific level. Additionally, being interactional and evolving as elaborated by the interactional model and acquisition of apology-gratitude expressions (Long, 2016, pp. 19 and 21, respectively), it seems to verify the dynamic nature of the model.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>However, at the culture-general level, assuming the concept of expectation to be unidimensional, the model illustrated a decision process based on ‘within’ or ‘outside of’ one and only one situational norm or expectation. It is unable to explain the multifaceted nature of expectation, such as multiple expectations and evolving expectations (see below for the difference between ‘evolving expectations’ and ‘evolving model of expectations’) which will be discussed in this section.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The multifaceted nature of expectation invalidates the over-simplified model covering two distinctive consequences of cognitive salience. In the subdiscipline of interpersonal communication in the organisational setting, the ‘alignment’ of individuals’ role to institutional role is complexed in dyadic negotiation (Koester, 2006, p. 161). Different from Long’s (2016) model arguing for only four possibilities in one sequence of relational work (p. 19), if considering one more role-relation expectation to each side, as shown in Figure 1, the condition will be much more complicated. It should be noticed that every more dimension of expectations or new role-relation will diversify the model exponentially.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In this complicated model, one behaviour may simultaneously fall within and outside of the expectation of certain side (e.g. section 10). Referring to the transcript in assignment 1 (see Appendix), if using Long’s (2016) model, Mona’s change from formal communication style to comparatively informal one might be because she ‘accept’ the newly indexed role-relation after an unexpected (hence contrastive) exchange. However, if allowing Mona to harbour multiple expectations, she may concurrently expect a formal meeting aligning to the organisation and an informal one by herself. The ultimate choice to follow which line is based on much more complicated cognitive mechanisms, perhaps including comparing and compromising.</p>
                <p><br>
                </p>
                  <p> Furthermore, this model as well as Long’s (2016) model cannot provide explanations for evolving expectation. Different from an ‘evolving model of expectations’ which highlight the changing nature of expectations (cf. Arundale, 2009), ‘evolving expectation’ indicates that the content of expectation may involve how the situation and the role-relation will change. Considering the acquisition of apology-gratitude expressions mentioned in the selected paper, Long (2016) proposed an evolving model of expectations and illustrated one particular development of role-relation assumption. However, this model arbitrarily claimed that the one-side shift of role-relation must be recognised as contrastive salience, neglecting the possibility that this shift per se may be expected or anticipated. As a partial revision, Figure 2 incorporates the evolving expectation into the original model.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Revised model for acquisition of apology-gratitude expressions (partial)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> It could be observed that in stage 1 two expectations exist at the same time, normative expectation (left) and evolving expectation (right) alike. Specifically, apart from the expectation of normative child/adult role-relation, the adult may also expect or anticipate a change of this norm to be adult/adult. If it is valid, the instances in stage 2 provided by Long (2016) may be concurrently correlative and contrastive to each of the two expectations of the adult. For example, if the child adopts a new expression (i.e. apology), it is salient contrastively to the normative linguistic representation and also correlatively to the anticipated change of role-relation expression. This phenomenon further rejects and complicates Long’s (2016) binary model on cognitive salience, which leads to the discussion at the affective level.</p>
			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> Affectively Unneutral Nature of Expectations</h4>
			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> This section aims at examining the cognitive-affective tie proposed in Long’s (2016) model. Based on the binary model of cognitive salience, three possibilities of affective salience were identified. It is assumed that, if the behaviour is correlatively salient, it may evoke a positive affective response, although this line of behaviours is typically unmarked without conscious evaluation. On the contrary, if contrastive salience emerges, the affective response of individual may be negative if the unexpected newly indexed role-relation was rejected, otherwise positive if accepted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Before discussing the topic mentioned in the title of this subsection, it should be noticed that the argument in Section 2.1 has already discredited some aspects of the affective elements in the model. For instance, if we allow the existence of multiple expectations and evolving expectations, the potential positive and negative affective responses may develop at the same time. If rejected one newly indexed role-relation but accepted the other, how the affect will be in the end falls outside the capacity of Long’s (2016) model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Except for the analysis in the earlier section, the present section will concentrate on the affective prosody carried by individuals’ expectation, which was neglected by Long (2016). Although in the following analysis the present essay may sometimes seem to presuppose the validity of the binary model and provide discussions within the binary paradigm, the new arguments below are not independent of but complementing to the previous ones, which should be understood in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> In Long’s (2016) model, the affective salience is totally from the cognitive salience, which seems to be affectively neutral. However, the norm or expectation per se may harbour certain emotional prosody, either positive or negative. Taking U.S school board meetings as an example, Tracy (2008, p. 170) argued that the ‘emotionally marked criticism of the past and future actions of public persons’ or ‘reasonable hostility’ could also be the situated norm compared with the polite or civil norms. If in this situation the hostility can be identified as a norm which entails negative affect, the so-called correlative salience with the behaviour inside expectation may not essentially bring about positive affect. Similarly, contrastive salience with a rejection of the newly indexed role-relation may not necessarily lead to negative affective responses, possibly derived from the positive prosody of the less normatively predictable expression such as an impromptu marriage proposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Also, in Long’s (2016) model, a reported contribution is its ability to explain discernment forms, which were categorised to be unmarked and correlatively salient. Based on his argument, it seems that the unmarked behaviours (i.e. discernment forms) were claimed to potentially be ‘the target of a conscious affective evaluation’ (Long, 2016, p. 17) although less likely to be. Apart from confirming this affective response with the participants in a post-hoc first order manner (cf. Long, 2016, p. 12), little suggestions were provided to account for how the unmarked behaviour can be consciously evaluated at an affective level. From the perspective of affectively unneutral expectations, it is argued that the unmarked cognitive salience (correlative) does not necessarily entail unmarked affective salience. If honorifics at a culture-specific level can be recognised to be positively indexed, the passive or normative usage of it (cognitively unmarked) can generate positive affective evaluations (affectively marked), and vice versa. The incorporation of this consideration may help specify and enhance the accountability of Long’s (2016) model, but questions it in more aspects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The rift between cognitive and affective unmarkedness discussed above also exists when negotiating newly indexed role-relations. In the model being reviewed, the acceptance and rejection of a new role-relation implied by unexpected behaviours will lead to positive and negative affect, respectively. Again, this model presupposes the affectively neutral nature of ‘acceptance’ and ‘rejection’, further claiming the close tie between this binary cognitive decision and affective salience. However, scholars should consider how and why the individuals will accept or reject a newly indexed role-relation, and whether this process is affectively unneutral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> For instance, the comparison of multiple affectively indexed expectations may happen in this decision process. With reference to the acquisition of apology-gratitude expressions presented in Figure 2, whether the adult will accept the new adult/adult role-relation is based on his/her comparison, evaluation, and even compromise of expectations made during the communication. Within this complicated process, the outcome of the affective response will be significantly influenced by how the expectations harbour affective prosody and how these expectations reach a compromise. If the anticipated change of role-relation to be adult/adult is endowed with anxiety, unhappiness, or the negative feeling of ‘being out of control’, the adult will certainly not have high level positive affective evaluation even if this new role-relation was accepted based on a compromise of this expectation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> In addition, even if the expectation is relatively neutral at affective level, the cognitive evaluation such as compromise per se may be affectively salient. The comparison of multiple expectations may be a real struggle with negative affect. If in the transcript of Assignment 1 Jack was hesitated between ‘staying silent as a recruit’ and ‘contributing ideas as a meeting member’, his emotion at this period should be judged by not only the finally expressed (or unexpressed) role-relation he took but also the earlier process of decision making which may inherently carry affective elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> Culture-general, Culture-specific, and Individual Differences</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The two subsections above discussed the validity of Long’s (2016) model by assessing the logic and components within it, whereas this section will evaluate the basic assumption of this social cognitive model, that is, salience. The discussion will comprise of two main parts, including (1) the individual differences (culture-specific or even first order) elements in the current so-called culture-general model; and (2) other dimensions of cognitive mechanisms in relational works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The current culture-general model is oversimplified, possibly to be in line with the basic cognitive schema. However, even apart from the invalidity of cognitive salience and affective salience discussed above, the notion of salience itself in the model may not be perfectly independent of culture-specific or even first order elements. That is because of the very important causal relation that normatively predictable behaviours (Terkourafi, 2005) would be recognised as unmarked ones (correlative salience), and vice versa. The present review is not to argue that the cognitive mechanism of ‘markedness’ is problematic, but the interpretation of marked behaviour may be different. Invoking the definition of ‘tolerance of ambiguity’ (Budner, 1962), individuals may perceive the uncertain or ambiguous situation as ‘desirable’, which rejects the current model. Also, if certain culture embraces the normatively unpredictable behaviours, the culture-general model fails to be compatible with the culture-specific one(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> This should be considered together with the subject of communication and the nature of culture. If we allow non-human subject such as organisation to be the participant of communication, the individuals who have aligned themselves with the goal of the higher order construct may not share the same cognitive mechanism. Also, although the cultivation of culture may not influence the cognitive mechanism of ‘markedness’ but may modify individuals’ interpretation of the marked phenomena. This echoes the critique of the affective response of cognitive salience. The tricky concept here is that the ‘markedness’ itself may not be affectively neutral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> In addition, Long’s (2016) model seems to depend on only one cognitive mechanism, which can be further elaborated. Invoking Maslow’s hierarchy (Maslow, 1950 cited in Goldwasser 2006, p. 79), participants may prioritise their basic needs when communicating with the others. For instance, concerning the need to be esteemed, if one perceived the context and the expression of the others to be supportive of his/her self-esteem, a positive affective response is highly possible regardless of whether the behaviour is normatively predictable or not. This will be more complex as it is assumed that the organisational context will enjoy a dissimilar list of basic needs (Goldwasser, 2006).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Also, in a similar social-cognitive model (Culpeper, 2011), the previous Goffmanian approach with a focus on ‘quality face’ (mutual evaluation) was criticised. It is suggested that more dimensions should be incorporated such as identity face and physical self. The notion of intentionality was discussed as well, to develop a more comprehensive model. For example, one can expect a certain level of separateness or connectedness with the interlocutor, but the impoliteness may be perceived as unintentional, which reduced its salience compared with the intentional aggression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> These new dimensions of cognitive mechanism lead to the discussion on what can be recognised as a culture-general model, and whether a culture-general model is another type of culture-specific model. The first important aspect of culture-general model, as argued by Long (2016), is its independence from culture-specific models. If the above critiques are valid, this essay has analysed the culture-specific elements which may exist within the cognitive mechanism of salience. A more trustworthy causal relation should be explored between the underlying cognitive mechanism of ‘markedness’ and the mechanism of relational works. Apart from ‘markedness’, more cognitive mechanisms should be involved. Additionally, following Long’s (2016) argument, it is hypothesised that the compatibility of culture-general model to culture-specific one is of utmost importance. If the concepts involved in the model may conflict with that in the culture-specific models, the capacity will be significantly undermined.</p>

                        </blockquote>
				  <p> The present essay critically reviewed the model proposed by Long (2016), which was reported to be a culture-general second order one. The first section examined its validity of the concept of expectation which was closely related to normative predictability. Two important issues were discussed, including multiple expectations and evolving expectations. If the individuals involved in the conversation were allowed to be diverse, the simple binary decision of cognitive salience might be flawed. In this respect, the main question to be addressed is the simultaneously occurred correlative and contrastive salience.</p>
			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <p> The second section discussed Long’s (2016) presupposition of the affectively neutral nature of situated norms. The emotional prosody of a certain situation (e.g. reasonable hostility) was evaluated to be against the simple relationship between cognitive salience and affective salience proposed in the model being reviewed. This argument was furthered by the discussion of the affective element harboured by the negotiation process (i.e. acceptance and rejection) of role-relations. A possible intermediate period before the real negotiation (e.g. comparison and compromise) is explored, also with its probability to be emotionally indexed. In this regard, the cognitive-affective tie promoted by Long (2016) was argued against.</p>
			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <p> The third section, based on the former two, investigated the core component, the cognitive mechanism of salience, implied by the model. How the individual differences will influence the validity of this concept was first assessed. The focus was on the hypothesised causal relation between correlative salience (normative predictability) and unmarkedness. It pointed to the culture-specific nature of the interpretation of less normatively predictable behaviours. Also, the single-factor model involving only ‘salience’ as the underlying cognitive mechanism was analysed. This leads to a brief discussion on the criteria of the culture-general model, and its speciality compared with culture-specific ones.</p>
			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <p> Nevertheless, it should be noticed that this present review was limited in multiple aspects. The most prevailing problem throughout the essay is the direct use of the binary distinction of cognitive and affective salience. Although the essay emphasised the possibility of the concurrently emerged two saliences, it fails to argue against whether the three or more options can be identified. For instance, the categorisation of positive and negative affective responses may be intrinsically limited, which should be refined in future studies.</p>
			    <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <p> Overall, the contribution of the present review lies in its reiteration that even culture-general model should be dynamic. This means that future models should allow the existence of dynamic expectations (multiple and evolving). Also, the cognitive-affective relationship should be assessed via greater cautions. It should be noticed that this does not mean that a culture-general model is comprehensive and cumbersome. Quite differently, it could be simple because the ultimate aim of it is to explore whether a general process can be identified regardless of the individual differences and cultural elements.</p>
